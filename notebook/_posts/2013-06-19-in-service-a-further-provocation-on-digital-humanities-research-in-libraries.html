  <p>I authored a post for the series, <a href="http://acrl.ala.org/dh/2013/06/19/make-it-new-a-dhlib-mini-series/">"Make It New?,"</a> commissioned by dh+lib to respond to a special issue of the Journal of Library Administration on digital humanities and libraries. In a way, this piece, which explores the diverse and complex histories of "service" and the "service ethic" in librarianship, is a follow-up to my earlier post, <a href="http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2012/08/19/doing-dh-in-the-library.html">"Digital humanities in the library isn't a service"</a>. I argue against a stable concept of "traditional library service" and further I argue that "deploying this term as though it had some stable meaning obscures rather than illuminates a long and complex history of information work relevant to this new moment." I'm grateful to the editors of dh+lib for including my piece in the collection.</p>
