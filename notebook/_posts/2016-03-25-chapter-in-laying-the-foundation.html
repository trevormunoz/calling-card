  <p>A chapter based on my <a href="http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2014/06/22/charleston-digital-humanities-and-libraries-conference.html">earlier talk</a> at the "Data Driven" conference has been published as part of a collection edited by John W. White and Heather Gilbert titled <em>Laying the Foundation: Digital Humanities in Academic Libraries</em>. The volume is published by Purdue University Press and is available open access thanks to <a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/">Knowledge Unlatched</a>.</p>

  <p>In this chapter I trace the eclipse of a humanist tradition in librarianship and speculate that the historical development of the profession helps explain why "the position of digital humanities work in many academic research libraries&mdash;as a service point for specialized consulting or training&mdash;suggests that DH is widely seen as external to the core functions of research libraries." I speculate that "incorporating digital humanities into the conceptual equipment and the work practices of more librarians could help to develop a tradition of humanist librarianship suited to our present technological age."</p>
