<div class="preface">
  <p>I'm pleased to have two new pieces published in Archive Journal 3, a peer-reviewed online journal focused on the use and theory of archives and special collections in higher education. The first is a research article, <a href="http://www.archivejournal.net/issue/3/archives-remixed/foundations-of-data-curation-the-pedagogy-and-practice-of-purposeful-work-with-research-data/">"Foundations of Data Curationâ€”The Pedagogy and Practice of 'Purposeful Work' with Research Data"</a>, co-authored with Carole L. Palmer, Nicholas Weber, and Allen Renear. The second is a contribution to the journal's <a href="http://www.archivejournal.net/issue/3/three-sixty/">360&deg; feature</a>.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.archivejournal.net/issue/3/">entire issue</a> looks wonderful.</p>
