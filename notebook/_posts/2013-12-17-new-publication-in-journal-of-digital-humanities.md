lede: My piece "Data Curation as Publishing for the Digital Humanities" is newly published in Volume 2, Number 3, of the Journal of Digital Humanities. What started as a short talk for a panel at the CIC Center for Library Initiatives conference was first published on my blog in Spring 2013. The version published in JDH includes substantive revisions and updates to my original argument. My thanks to the editors of JDH for selecting my piece for inclusion in the journal.
