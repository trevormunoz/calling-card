I was invited to help facilitate one of the workshops for the [“Resilient Networks to Support Inclusive Digital Humanities (DH)”](http://library.gwu.edu/resilient-networks) initiative, a collaboration between George Washington University, Rice University, Davidson College, and Prairie View A&amp;M University funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Over the course of two days, the group wanted to work on developing ideas for collaborations. So, we talked about strategies for generating research ideas, basics of working with data as humanists, and good practices for when ideas become projects.

A condensed version of my slides, omitting some of the specific instructions for hands-on exercises, can be found embedded below as well as on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/trevormunoz/from-research-ideas-to-projects).

"Resilient Networks" is an exciting initiative and I'm looking forward to seeing the work of these folks over the next couple of years. Thanks to Lisa Spiro, Angela Spidalette, Geneva Henry, and the participants from GWU, Rice, PVAMU, and Davidson for inviting me to be part of the workshop.
