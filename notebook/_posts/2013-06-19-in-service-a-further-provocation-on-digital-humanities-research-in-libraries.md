lede: I authored a post for the series, "Make It New?", commissioned by dh+lib to respond to a special issue of the Journal of Library Administration on digital humanities and libraries. In a way, this piece, which explores the diverse and complex histories of "service" and the "service ethic" in librarianship, is a follow-up to my earlier post, "Digital humanities in the library isn't a service." I'm grateful to the editors of dh+lib for including my piece in the collection.
