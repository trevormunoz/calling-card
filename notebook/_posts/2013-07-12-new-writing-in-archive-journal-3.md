lede: I'm pleased to have two new pieces published in Archive Journal 3, a peer-reviewed online journal focused on the use and theory of archives and special collections in higher education. The first is a research article, "Foundations of Data Curationâ€”The Pedagogy and Practice of 'Purposeful Work' with Research Data", and the second is a contribution to the journal's 360&deg; feature.
