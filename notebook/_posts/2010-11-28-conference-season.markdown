title: Conference Season
lede: The 6th International Digital Curation Conference (to be held in Chicago) follows the recently-concluded Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science &#8212; it's conference season for me &#8212; as good a reason as any to add a place for more long-form writing to this site

First, let me say: I've been very happy with [Twitter][twitter]. 

Most of what I have to say about the topic-of-the-day can fit in 140 characters. Many days that's all I have time to write anyway. Often I only want to share a link to a new paper or project, or discover the same from someone else. The digital humanities community is very active and the twitter-stream is a good way to keep up with what's going on in my field. Also, I've had a chance to "meet" and interact with other scholars who share my interests but not my time zone, and that's been a great boon.

So, why grant myself the dubious freedom to run on longer than an (elliptical) sentence or two?

Before the Thanksgiving holiday, I attended the [2010 Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science][dhcs], held in Evanston, November 21st and 22nd. I had a great time and the conference was, I thought, very well-done &#8212; a strong mix of speakers, panels, posters, and attendees. (Congratulations to all the organizers, especially Martin Mueller and Nathan Mead.)

Data curation received prominent mentions and several presentations (as well as events at [THATCamp Chicago][thatcamp], which took place the day before the conference and which I was unfortunately too busy to attend) gave me new ideas for some work I'm doing on collaboration and, specifically the role of documentation in collaboration around open standards. (Topics for future posts ...)

My principal reason for attending the Colloquium was to help present a poster describing some of the work of the [Data Curation Education Program for the Humanities (DCEP-H)][dceph], for which I am a Research Assistant this year. Thanks to everyone who stopped by to chat.

In a week, I'll be back in Chicago for the [6th International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC)][idcc]. Thanks to the support of the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS)][cirss] I was able to attend the conference last year when it was held in London. That was an informative, enriching experience &#8212; I enjoyed the community such that IDCC might give the [Digital Humanities Conference][dh11] a run for its money as my "home" conference. I will almost certainly write more about the relationship I see between these two fields: digital humanities and data curation.

So, why a "blog" now? I've discovered that I have more to say. I hope, dear reader, you find something useful here too.
