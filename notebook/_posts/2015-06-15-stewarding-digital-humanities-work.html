    I wrote a piece for the MITH blog explaining some of our strategies for stewarding digital humanities work published on the web. From the piece:
    <blockquote>
      At MITH, we have chosen a stewardship strategy that entails both actively managing systems that still run a variety of websites and also taking actions to preserve copies and alternate representations of these sites including through retention of compressed offline archives of project data, through web archiving, and through deposit of supplementary materials and documentation with both our (digital) institutional repository and our (analog) university archives.
    </blockquote>
