title: IDCC &#8212; Pre-Conference Workshop

The [6th International Digital Curation Conference][idcc] is taking place in Chicago over the next three days. I'll be attending one of the [pre-conference workshops][workshops] today.  The advertisement for the session promises "an overview of current UK activity in identifying and aligning data
management and curation skills across a range of disciplines." I'm looking forward to it and hoping to gather ideas for a project I'm involved with at GSLIS that is focused on delivering data curation training to humanities researchers.

I will try to post notes here during the course of the morning. Also, the Twitter hashtag for the event is [#idcc10][hashtag].
