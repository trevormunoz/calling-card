	<h2>About Trevor</h2>
	<p>I am a second-year master's student at the <a href="http://www.lis.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Graduate School of Library and Information Science</a>, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p> 
	<p>My background is in Digital Humanities. I completed a master's degree in Digital Humanities at the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/cch" target="_blank">Centre for Computing in the Humanities</a>, King's College London, in 2009. While at King's I focused mainly on electronic publishing and digital literary studies though I have since worked on a number of digital history projects as well. I graduated from <a href="http://harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> with a bachelor's degree in English in 2005.</p> 
	
	<p>My current research centers on data curation for (digital) humanities research.</p>
	
	<p>Information about projects I've worked on can be found <a href="/projects/">here</a>.</p> 
	
	<p>A list of my publications and presentations is available <a href="/about/publications/">here</a>.</p>
