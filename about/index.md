Trevor Muñoz is Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the [University of Maryland Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/about/deans-office/mission) and an Associate Director of the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](http://mith.umd.edu/). He works to foster digital projects that involve close collaboration between librarians, archivists, and other digital humanities researchers. As part of this work, he has written, spoken, and consulted about the strategic opportunities and challenges of doing digital humanities work within the institutional and cultural structures of academic research libraries. Muñoz holds an MA in Digital Humanities from the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London and an MS in Library and Information Science from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He currently serves as a core team member for the ["Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture" (AADHum)](http://go.umd.edu/aadhum-exec-summary) initiative.

I recommend [Curating Menus](http://www.curatingmenus.org/) and ["Digital humanities in the library isn't a service"](http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2012/08/19/doing-dh-in-the-library.html) as good places to start if you'd like to become more familiar with my work.
