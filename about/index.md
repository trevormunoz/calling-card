Trevor Muñoz is Director of the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](http://mith.umd.edu/). His work focuses on humanities approaches to data curation and on the design and sustainability of interdisciplinary research collaborations. Muñoz holds an MA in Digital Humanities from the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London and an MS in Library and Information Science from the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He currently serves as a co-Principal Investigator for the ["African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities" (AADHum)](http://www.aadhum.umd.edu/) initiative. With Jennifer Guiliano, he also serves as Co-Director of the [Humanities Intensive Learning + Teaching (HILT) Institute](http://dhtraining.org/hilt/).

I recommend [Curating Menus](http://www.curatingmenus.org/) and ["Digital humanities in the library isn't a service"](http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2012/08/19/doing-dh-in-the-library.html) as good places to start if you'd like to become more familiar with my work.
